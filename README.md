# Covid19Project
An Exploratory Data Analysis with accompanying Dashboard

This is a Project that I undertook to solidify my SQL skills and to get more familiar with Tableau as a platform. As someone with a healthcare background, I wanted to explore how exactly the Vaccine affected the outbreak of Covid around the world. From a time where Hospitals were in crisis with a lack of ventilators to now having people interact face to face again, a lot has changed. Was the impetus the spread of vaccines across the world, or did the majority of the pandemic takes it courses and it was just the nail in the coffin? 

This project also compares countries and their responses through 6 six "Key Indicators" as I have called them, which will feature throughout the Data Visualization. 

The First problem I encountered was which version of SQL to use, after a lengthy trial and error process, I settled on MySQL 8.0. MySQL had its quirks that I had to learn about such as casting to integers and the ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY error which I came to love. Overall, once I got more familiar with it, I enjoyed the troubleshooting process.

Outside of SQL, I used Tableau Public for my visualizations. This means that I needed to download my Queries as .csv files then upload it to Public instead of having a direct connection. This added the extra step of Data Cleaning in Excel to make sure they were not any Blanks or NULLS that would affect the final product. 

Finally, in Tableau I came to learn about flexibility and how to make adjustments on the fly. For example I wanted to make a Stacked Bar Chart for a time series, but the values for vaccinations were so much greater than the other measure that it didn't make sense to pursue it. This was a key chart for the viz, so I had to find a way to get the same idea across, with just as little effort needed from the viewer to understand it. 

Thank you for viewing my project and I appreciate any feedback you may have!
